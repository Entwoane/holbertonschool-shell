Where am I? : print the absolute path of current working directory

What's in there?: display content of current directory

There's no place like home:change working directory

The long format: display current directory in long format

Hidden files:display current directory content with hidden files

I love numbers: display long format and hidden content list with uid

Welcome: creating my_first_directory in /tmp/

Betty in my first directory: creating and moving betty file in /tmp/my_first_directory

Bye bye Betty: delete file betty from /tmp/my_first_directory

Bye bye my first directory: delete my_first_directory from /tmp/

Back to the future:script that change the working dir to the previous one
